This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a personal recipe app that is meant to store up personal recipes.
The app aims to store recipes of an individual.
This app mainly uses Javascript in a React framework.
I intend to add a login page which can then navigate to the interface of the app as well as a page to display the 
user's data.
It is very user friendly and interactive.
I still have some changes I need to make it more interacive and appealing.
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.
