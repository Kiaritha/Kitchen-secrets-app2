# Getting Started with Create React App

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).
It is a personal recipe ap that is meant to store up ne personal recies.
The app aims to store recipes of an individual.
This app mainly uses Javascrit in a Reach framework.
I intend to add a login page which can then navigate to the interface of the app as well as a pageto display the 
user's data.
It is very user friendly and interactive.

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3001](http://localhost:3001) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.
